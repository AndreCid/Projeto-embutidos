To install the contents of this .tgz package into /usr/local/Arnl,
run "make install" as the root user, or "sudo make install" 
if you have the "sudo" tool.

Required tools for install are: GNU make 3.81 or later, 'install' tool, Bourne
shell or compatible.

Note that in addition to a localization library (Arnl, SonArnl, or Mogs), you
must also install the BaseArnl package, which contains the BaseArnl,
AriaForArnl and ArNetworkingForArnl libraries and header files, and
other neccesary files.

See also README.txt for more information on getting started, and the reference
manuals.
